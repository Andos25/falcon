# Pushing a New Version

Nunjucks attempts to adhere to semantic versioning. The API is very stable, so from here on out it will most likely be point releases.

1. Do a `pull` from github to make sure you have all the latest updates

2. View all the changes and update CHANGELOG.md:

```
$ git log --oneline v1.2.3..master
```

Replace `v1.2.3` with whatever the last version was, and you'll see all the changes going out in this version. Add a new version to CHANGELOG.md and write some notes about what's going out.

3. Run the command to make sure the ready-made files for the browser are up-to-date.

```
$ make browserfiles
```

4. Update the version in `package.json`

5. Commit above changes and push to `master`
